# mid-project
Ironhack mid term project. Create a responsive web page from a given design


Hello there, my name is Valentina I'm student of front-end development at Ironhack Bootcamp. 
This project is a delivery for my course and I'm happy to share it with you.
I'm studying HTML, CSS and Java Script and I hope to show that I learnt something in these last months.

I was given a designed webpage on figma, it's a webpage for a company that builds webpages. 
I used HTML, CSS and a bit of Java Script. 

The webpage is provided by a navigation bar that helps the user going trough the main sections of my page. 
We have cards with links which the user can click to see differents projects the company have worked on. 
There is also a form trough which the user can get in contact with the company.
Well I just connected it to a local Json for now but there is the Java Script working to connect it with a server in the future.

I will mentioned some tools and tutorials I used for helping:
